Hi! I'm an indie developer based in Shenzhen, China.

Stoic Digital Craftsman (Guitarist / Developer / Designer)

Building creative tools like [Tab Flow for Obsidian](https://github.com/LIUBINfighter/Obsidian-Tab-Flow). Exploring AI, music, and the art of productive leisure (Otium).

## Here's the story

Jay Bridge is an undergraduate in SUSTech, driven by a desire to live a free and peaceful life. After a time spent in the world of robotics and physics competitions, he decided to make something cool and useful in his workspace and fell in love with the design and philosophy of Obsidian.

Like many young people, Jay used to be concerned about freedom, wealth, and the future. His INFP-T personality brings both deep insights and a fair share of anxiety.

如果财富自由后我还会做同样的事（弹吉他，写代码，读书和思考），为什么不现在开始做呢？

> Even if I were nothing, I could still play the guitar.

> 即使我什么都不是，我还可以弹弹吉他。

The guitar has been a constant companion throughout Jay's second decade of life, and it's clear it will see him through his third as well. To play his favorite songs, he began exploring ways to play guitar tabs with metronome marks, write sheet music in plain text, and train Visual Language Models (VLMs) to convert static image tabs into interactive text formats. Here come the Tab Flow(Obsidian plugin) and Simple Tabify (alphaTex ocr model).

吉他陪伴了Jay人生中的第二个十年，显然，第三个十年也会是这样。为了弹奏自己喜欢的歌曲，Jay开始研究如何播放带节拍器的吉他谱，用纯文本书写曲谱，甚至使用VLM将静态的图片谱转化为可以直接阅读和修改的文本。这就是Obsidian吉他谱插件 Tab Flow 和 Simple Tabify (OMR光学字符识别)系列大模型的原始想法。

Recognizing his own limitations and the brevity of life doesn’t confine him; it frees him to focus on what is truly essential.

Looking at the world around, even if it’s full of geniuses, Jay know there are things that only he can do.

认识到自己的局限和生命的短暂，反而能让我们专注于那些值得做也不得不做的事。

环视自己的周围，即使都是天才，我也有只有我才能去做的事。

The moment Jay understood that an ideal life isn't a prize you win after suffering, but a continuous journey toward inner peace, everything changed. He started to enjoy his bursts of inspiration, and leave no space to worry.

From vscode to github, Jay discovered the beauty of DevOps and agile development. He sees it as a practice of "code as design"—a way to collaborate with AI and enter a state of flow.

在这个过程中我逐渐领会到和ai一起搞devops和敏捷开发的好玩之处，那就是code as design。

Now Jay is still working on Tab Flow & Simple Tabify. Feel free to check out his projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/LIUBINfighter) or read more of his thoughts on this blog.

现在我继续开发着 Tab Flow 和 Simple Tabify, 同时享受下在南科大自由自在，充盈着奇思妙想的闲暇。欢迎查看[我在Github上的项目](https://github.com/LIUBINfighter)以及阅读本博客的其他文章。
